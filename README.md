I also attached my resume, the logo, the text for a short speech, and an old headshot. I’m planning to get a new headshot soon, but have attached this one as a placeholder. I’m thinking of the tagline: Seeking Truth. Pursuing Justice. 

Thank You!

I really like the format and how clean it is. I think the words shouldn’t be covering her photo. I do like the contact the campaign boxes right up front too.

I like how clean it is but the ordering and layout feel disconnected.
